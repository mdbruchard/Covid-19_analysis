# Covid-19_analysis
 
This is my first project using Tableau. I collected the dataset in 3 differents sources:
1. I web scrape [Worldmeter](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/) to collect the most recent covid dataset
2. Then I collected all the first case in each country web scrapping [First cases on Wiki](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_by_country_and_territory)
3. I also collected the countries that have lockdown [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_lockdowns)

Once I collected all the three dataset I clean them and made my fist dashboard on [Tableau](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/matheus.de.bruchard/viz/Covidexploration/Dashboard1)
