# Covid-19_analysis

This project is about covid analysis. THe main idea behind of this project is to is to ubild a end-to-end project where I collect the data, clean it and also explore it. The reason why I decide to do project about Covid was a the curiosity to know if the lockdown applied in the countries prevent the Covid spread.

One of the graph on the Tableau (Scatter plot) show the there are more cases in counties tha to longer to apply lockdown.
 
This is my first project using Tableau. I collected the dataset in 3 differents sources:
1. I web scrape [Worldmeter](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/) to collect the most recent covid dataset
2. Then I collected all the first case in each country web scrapping [First cases on Wiki](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_by_country_and_territory)
3. I also collected the countries that have lockdown [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_lockdowns)

Once I collected all the three dataset I clean them using **Microsoft Excel** using the cleaning tools and formulas and made my fist dashboard on [Tableau](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/matheus.de.bruchard)
